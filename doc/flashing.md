Downloading the release package
-------------------------------

The latest binary release package is available on the
[GitHub release section](https://github.com/retro16/acsi2stm/releases)

Using precompiled binary packages removes the hassle of installing a full
Arduino environment.

There are many compile-time options, so if none of these variants match your
needs (or your tastes), see the [compiling](compiling.md) section.


Firmware variants in the release package
----------------------------------------

Newer ACSI2STM release packages have many variants to choose from:

### acsi2stm-XXXX.ino.bin

Standard firmware.

### acsi2stm-XXXX-strict.ino.bin

Reduced firmware with GemDrive permanently disabled, just like if you set BOOT1
to force ACSI mode. All SD cards behave like Atari hard drives.

Compile-time options:

    #define ACSI_STRICT 1

### acsi2stm-XXXX-debug.ino.bin

The standard firmware, with limited debug output.

Compile-time options:

    #define ACSI_DEBUG 1
    #define ACSI_STACK_CANARY 4096

### acsi2stm-XXXX-verbose.ino.bin

The standard firmware, with verbose debug output. Very slow.

Compile-time options:

    #define ACSI_DEBUG 1
    #define ACSI_VERBOSE 1
    #define ACSI_STACK_CANARY 4096

### acsi2stm-XXXX-legacy.ino.bin

Same as standard firmware, but for older 2.x units that don't have the necessary
hardware modifications (reset line and read-only switch).

Compile-time options:

    #define ACSI_HAS_RESET 0
    #define ACSI_SD_WRITE_LOCK 0


## Which variant should I choose ?

Most users should use the standard firmware.

If you are building a unit, you may be interested in the debug firmware to
diagnose potential issues with your hardware.

If you found a bug or a strange behavior and wish to do a bug report, verbose
output may be requested: in that case, use the verbose firmware.

If you know you have an old unit without a reset line, use the "legacy" variant.

If your SD card is stuck in read-only mode, you need to do hardware
modifications. If you cannot do that (or don't want to), use the legacy variant.


Flashing the firmware
---------------------

If you want to flash using Arduino, it's simpler to just install everything and
compile your own variant. See [compiling](compiling.md) for more details.

The only supported way to program the STM32 is via its serial (USART) port.

To connect to the STM32, you need a 3.3V compatible USB-USART dongle such as
this one:

![USB USART module](images/usb_serial.jpg)

Set the USB dongle to 3.3V if you have a jumper for that. Connect TX to PA10, RX
to PA9 and the GND pins together.

On the board itself, set the BOOT0 jumper to 1 to enable the serial flash
bootloader.

To upload the firmware, you need the `stm32flash` command-line tool available on
the [Arduino_STM32](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/master/tools)
repository, in the tools subdirectory.

Sample stm32flash command-line:

    stm32flash -w acsi2stm-XXXX.ino.bin /dev/ttyUSB0

You need to adapt the command-line for your setup: /dev/ttyUSB0 should point at
the virtual serial port connected to the STM32 (on Windows it looks like COM1:)

Once the chip is programmed, switch the BOOT0 jumper back to 0, then reset the
STM32 (press the button or do a power cycle).
